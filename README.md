# Heart_Disease
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart & blood vessels that are the leading cause of death globally. According to WHO, 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Using Machine Learning in the healthcare sector can assist physicians & doctors in predicting disease at the early stage. So, it is necessary to select a high-accuracy model. Machine Learning (ML) & Neural networks are the branch of data science that can be applied to detect CVDs at the early stage of the disease. This article presents a comparison among algorithms of data science to determine which one is the best for predicting CVDs. Combination of Cleveland, Statlog & Hungarian datasets with 1190 patients' information in 11 common features used in this research study. We found some supervised ML algorithms gave good accuracy than ANN in predicting disease. Among ML techniques, XG-Boost (n_estimators=500) gave the best accuracy with 94%, whereas ANN gave 91% accuracy. In this paper, we investigate & provide a wide overview of using Machine Learning classifiers. Selecting the best algorithm can aid doctors & physicians in detecting CVDs of patients at the primary stage & ensure their treatment.
